# w2-portfolio

## Description

I have been tasked to create a portfolio page. I have utilisied core skills such as flexbox, media queries and CSS varaibles in the creation of this page. I have shown my work samples so that an employer can review my work.

I have included my name, a recent photo and links in the navigation to sections about myself, my work and my contact details. My first application image is larger than the others and all images link through to my projects. The page has a responsive layout that adapts to the reader's viewport. 

## Links

## Development

The initial visual development of the page went along very smoothly but I struggled with utilising flexboxes and media queries in some cases. I feel that I need to do further self-teaching into the subjects to get a better grasp of how to utilise these concepts but I was able to do what was tasked of me regardless. I had to change some of the structual aspects of the website in order to accomadate easier coding to make up for my difficulties, so hopefully I can overcome that in the future. I didn't give much thought to the aesthetics as it wasn't required, but I am regretful that I couldn't figure out how to create a sidebar for the work section without the photo box placements becoming too difficult to control. I will work on this in the future. 

I also feel the HTML and CSS could have been better condensed. I think the primary lesson I've learnt from this project is to better pre-plan the writing of my code in plain terms before I start coding.

I recieved feedback on my first project after I began this one to utilise .gitignore to get rid of the .DS-store file and to use "w1" at the end of the repo name instead of the beginning so I'll put that into practice next challenge.

Advice
1. Use a .gitignore in future repo’s, “type in “.DS_store” and that’ll prevent those files from appearing in your repo. 
2. Use “w1” at the end of the repo name. 

## Usage

Aesthetic design was not a priority for me in the creation of this project and I attempted to emulate the example image of the project instructions to simplify the matter of aesthetic choices.

The links in the navigational bar successfully anchor link to the described sections of the page. The image boxes displaying and describing the projects link through to the respective GitHub repository's for those projects.
