# w2-portfolio

## Description

I have been tasked to create a portfolio page. I have utilisied core skills such as flexbox, media queries and CSS varaibles in the creation of this page. I have shown my work samples so that an employer can review my work.

I have included my name, a recent photo and links in the navigation to sections about myself, my work and my contact details. My first application image is larger than the others and all images link through to my projects. The page has a responsive layout that adapts to the reader's viewport. 

## Links

Link to deployed website:

## Development
Lessons learned about refactoring code based on the completion of this project:
- How to fix broken anchor links by attaching an Id to a section. 
- How to fix repeating code by combining repetitive type selectors into grouping selectors.
- How to convert images defined into CSS into HTML code. Doing this allowed me to add an alt text to this image.
- How to simplify a section class into an img class.
- The importance of ordering headings sequentially. 

I also learned to make classes more semantically convenient. Examples:
- Re-naming classes for better clarity (i.e. "benefit-lead" to "lead-generation" to create a more consistent naming scheme through out the entire code.)
- Changing a type selector into a descendent selector in order to make the purpose of the selector more semantically clear.

## Usage

As I can demonstrate in the screenshots below, despite a large portion of the code being changed the website still looks exactly the same as before. I have managed to improve the website's code functionality and accessibility without impacting on the visual design.

The links in the navigational bar successfully anchor link to the described sections of the page. 
The rest of the website is not interactive but all aspects of the website are displayed correctly.

I have heavily relied on lessons taught through the module 2 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs. I also did some minor googling to receive information that I did not use heavily enough to require attribution.
